Name Entity Recognition Using Conditional Random Fields

Name Entity extraction,also known as entity name extraction or named entity recognition, is an information extraction technique that refers to the process of identifying and classifying key elements from text into pre-defined categories.

### Conditional Random Fields are An undirected graphical model to find pattern recognition in structured prediction.

CRF is an undirected discriminative probabilistic graphical model
No natural condition between the nodes
Conditional probabilities are replaced by affinity or factor (when the neighbor node is known)
It is cyclic in nature Always depends on the immediate neighbors
